# Theme Configuration
# -------------------
# Like the _config.yml in the site source this file too requires to be
# a Hash and similarly allows arbitrary variables to be defined which
# can be accessed within the templates either as
# {{ site.data.[theme-name].myvariable }} or by simply using the 'theme'
# namespace like: {{ theme.myvariable }}. To override, simply create
# a data-file using the keys defined here. When overriding a mapping,
# any sub-key undefined at site-source will not fallback to the defined
# sub-key of the same mapping here.
